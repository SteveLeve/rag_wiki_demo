    "## Next Steps and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade to Persistent Storage with PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current limitation**: Embeddings are lost when the notebook restarts, requiring 50+ minutes to regenerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Upgrade to the advanced version with PostgreSQL + pgvector:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **See** `wikipedia-rag-tutorial-advanced.ipynb` for the PostgreSQL version\n",
    "2. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Generate embeddings once, reuse across experiments\n",
    "   - Store multiple embedding models for comparison\n",
    "   - Run analyses in minutes instead of regenerating\n",
    "   - Easy migration path to production databases\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quick start**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Start PostgreSQL\n",
    "   docker run -d --name pgvector-rag \\\n",
    "     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \\\n",
    "     -e POSTGRES_DB=rag_db \\\n",
    "     -p 5432:5432 \\\n",
    "     -v pgvector_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\n",
    "     pgvector/pgvector:pg16\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Install PostgreSQL adapter\n",
    "   pip install psycopg2-binary\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Open the advanced notebook\n",
    "   jupyter notebook wikipedia-rag-tutorial-advanced.ipynb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other RAG Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector similarity with keyword search (BM25)\n",
    "   - Better for specific terminology and exact matches\n",
    "   - Combine results using reciprocal rank fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reranking**: Use a [reranking model](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/rag/rerankers/)\n",
    "   - Cross-encoder models for better relevance\n",
    "   - Re-score top 10-20 results from initial retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Expansion**: Generate multiple query variations\n",
    "   - Use LLM to create related questions\n",
    "   - Retrieve for each and merge results\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Better Chunking**:\n",
    "   - Semantic chunking (split by meaning)\n",
    "   - Overlapping chunks for better context\n",
    "   - Parent-child chunks (retrieve child, return parent)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Citation Support**:\n",
    "   - Track which chunks were used\n",
    "   - Provide Wikipedia URLs as sources\n",
    "   - Show confidence scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced RAG Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph RAG**: Build knowledge graphs from Wikipedia links\n",
    "- **Agentic RAG**: Let the LLM decide when to retrieve more information\n",
    "- **Multi-hop RAG**: Follow reasoning chains across multiple documents\n",
    "- **RAG Fusion**: Combine multiple retrieval strategies\n",
